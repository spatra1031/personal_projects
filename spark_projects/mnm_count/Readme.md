# Objective:

The objective of the project "mnm_count" is to:

Deploy and discuss the structure of a Spark Application.
Compare and contrast the difference between a PySpark and Scala Spark Application.
Explain the concept of File Paths and how they are used to load data into a Spark Cluster.
Compile a significant Spark application and understand its structure.
Learn how to deal with file paths and load data into a Spark Cluster for Data Analysis.
Code Explanation and Output:
Both the Python and Scala code snippets provided are aimed at achieving the same objective. They are designed to read M&M candy data from a CSV file, perform data analysis using Apache Spark, and display the results.

# Python Code Explanation:

The Python code utilizes PySpark to perform the data analysis.
It takes a CSV file path as an argument.
Reads the CSV file into a DataFrame.
Performs data aggregation operations such as grouping by state and color, summing the counts, and ordering by count in descending order.
Displays the aggregated data for all states and specifically for the state of California (CA).
Finally, it stops the Spark session.

# Scala Code Explanation:

The Scala code uses Apache Spark's Scala API.
It follows a similar structure to the Python code.
Reads the CSV file into a DataFrame.
Performs the same data aggregation operations.
Displays the aggregated data for all states and specifically for the state of California (CA).
Stops the Spark session.

# Expected Output:

The expected output of running either the Python or Scala code would be:

A table showing the aggregated M&M counts grouped by state and color.
The output is sorted by the sum of counts in descending order.
Additionally, for the state of California (CA), a subset of the data is displayed, showing the aggregated counts for different M&M colors.
The total number of rows in the aggregated DataFrame is also printed.
This project serves as a hands-on exercise to understand the structure of a Spark application, compare PySpark and Scala Spark implementations, and learn how to work with data files within a Spark cluster for analysis purposes.
