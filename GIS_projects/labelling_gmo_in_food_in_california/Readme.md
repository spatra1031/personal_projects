## ★ Project Overview ★
This project explores **voting patterns in California’s 2012 election** on **Proposition 37**, the ballot measure concerning GMO food labeling.  
The goal was to use **GIS and spatial analysis** to map how support for the measure varied geographically across California counties.

---

## ★ Problem ★
Election results are often presented as raw numbers or percentages, which makes it difficult for the public and policymakers to **see spatial patterns** in how people vote.  
Understanding **regional variation** in voting behavior is crucial for:
- Identifying geographic divides in policy support.  
- Understanding the influence of demographics and regional factors.  
- Improving how election data is communicated to the public.  

---

## ★ Purpose ★
This project aimed to:
- Create a **county-level map** showing the percentage of “Yes” votes in California’s 2012 election on Proposition 37.  
- Symbolize voting outcomes with a **choropleth map** to highlight patterns across the state.  
- Demonstrate the use of **GIS in political and social analysis**.  

---

## ★ Solution ★
Using **ArcGIS Pro**, I:  
1. Imported **county boundaries** and **election results** datasets.  
2. Joined election results (Yes/Total votes) to county polygons.  
3. Created a **choropleth map** symbolized by percentage of Yes votes.  
4. Applied **Natural Breaks classification** to show regional variation.  
5. Added standard map elements (legend, scale bar, north arrow, title, author, sources).

## ★ Tools & Technologies ★
- **ArcGIS Pro** → Geospatial analysis and cartography  
- **Data Sources**:  
  - UC Davis Precinct Voting Data  
  - Esri, HERE, Garmin, USGS, Intermap

## ★ Results ★
- Produced a **map of California counties** symbolized by percentage of Yes votes for GMO labeling (2012).  
- Revealed clear **regional divides** in voter support, highlighting urban–rural differences.  
- Demonstrated the value of **spatial analysis in electoral studies**.
