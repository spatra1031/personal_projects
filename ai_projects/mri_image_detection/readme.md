# MRI Brain Tumor Detection AI
A deep learning-based web application that detects brain tumors from MRI scans. This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to classify MRI images into four categories: glioma, meningioma, no tumor, and pituitary tumor. The model is integrated into a Streamlit web app for easy and interactive diagnosis.

## Key Features
âœ” Deep Learning-Based MRI Tumor Classification
âœ” User-Friendly Streamlit Web Interface
âœ” Automated Image Preprocessing & Normalization
âœ” Interactive Upload & Real-Time Prediction
